        text: `
            <p>High above the world, the Sun and the Moon loved each other deeply. But they had a problem, little Avi. They could never be together at the same time.</p>
            
            <p>When the Sun rose each morning, painting the sky in gold and orange, the Moon had to say goodbye and rest. And when the Moon came out to dance among the stars, the Sun had to slip below the horizon.</p>
            
            <p>"How can we show our love," asked the Moon, "when we can never be together?"</p>
            
            <p>The Sun thought and thought. "We may not share the same sky," she said, "but we can share the same world. Each day, I will warm the flowers you love. Each night, you can shine on the oceans I've kissed. We will love the same Earth, together."</p>
            
            <p>And so they did. The Sun warmed the day, and the Moon cooled the night. The Sun grew the forests, and the Moon called to the tides. They were always apart, but they were never alone.</p>
            
            <p>Because real love, dear Avi, doesn't need to be in the same place at the same time. Real love is choosing the same dreams, caring for the same world, and knowing in your heart that someone is always thinking of you—even across the sky.</p>

        text: `
            <p>Once, a tiny seed fell between two great stones. It was dark there. Cold. The stones pressed close together, and there was barely any room to grow.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm stuck," said the seed. "I'll never become a tree."</p>
            
            <p>But deep inside that seed was something special—a tiny spark that wouldn't give up. So the seed did the only thing it could do. It reached. One small root, then another, searching for soil.</p>
            
            <p>Day after day, the roots pushed through tiny cracks. Week after week, a small green shoot pressed upward, searching for light. The stones didn't move. The way didn't get easier. But the seed kept reaching.</p>
            
            <p>Years passed. That little seed became a mighty tree, and do you know what happened to those stones? The tree's roots had grown so strong that they lifted the stones apart. Where there had been no way, the tree had made a way.</p>
            
            <p>People came from far away to see the tree growing from stone. "How did you do it?" they asked.</p>
            
            <p>The tree rustled its leaves and whispered: "I didn't move the stones all at once. I just grew a little bit each day. Even when it was hard. Even when I couldn't see the sun yet. I kept growing toward it."</p>
            
            <p><em>Remember this, Avi: You don't have to move mountains in a day. You just have to keep growing, even through the stones.</em></p>

        text: `
            <p>In the great savanna lived the smallest lion cub anyone had ever seen. His name was Tau, which means "lion" in a language from far away.</p>
            
            <p>All the other cubs were bigger, faster, louder. When they practiced their roars, the ground shook. When Tau tried to roar, it came out as a squeak.</p>
            
            <p>"I'll never be brave like them," Tau thought sadly.</p>
            
            <p>One day, a terrible fire started in the dry grass. All the big lions roared warnings—so loud that the small animals froze in fear and couldn't move. The rabbits huddled together. The meerkats stood still. They were too frightened to run.</p>
            
            <p>But Tau's small voice could speak softly. He ran to the rabbits and whispered, "Follow me, I know a safe way." His voice didn't scare them. They listened. He led them to the river.</p>
            
            <p>Then he ran back for the meerkats, the birds, the mice. Trip after trip, while the other lions roared their big roars, little Tau used his small voice to guide everyone to safety.</p>
            
            <p>When the fire was out, the elder lion called everyone together. "Tau," she said, "you showed the truest courage today. The others showed strength—but you showed something greater. You helped those who needed you, even when you were afraid."</p>
            
            <p><em>Sweet Avi, courage isn't about being the biggest or the loudest. Courage is doing what needs to be done, even when your paws are shaking. Even when your roar is small. Especially then.</em></p>

        text: `
            <p>The Rain was very sad. Everywhere it went, people ran away. They closed their windows, grabbed their umbrellas, and hurried inside.</p>
            
            <p>"Everyone hates me," cried the Rain. "I just wanted to visit the earth."</p>
            
            <p>A wise old Cloud floated by and said, "Rain, you're thinking only about yourself. Look closer at where you fall."</p>
            
            <p>So the Rain looked. Really looked. And the Rain began to see things it had never noticed before.</p>
            
            <p>There was a garden where an old woman had been praying for her flowers. The Rain fell there first, gently, and watched her face light up with joy.</p>
            
            <p>There was a river that was running low, where fish were struggling. The Rain filled it back up, and the fish danced in the fresh water.</p>
            
            <p>There was a child with a new red umbrella who had been waiting all week to use it. The Rain fell softly, and the child splashed and laughed in every puddle.</p>
            
            <p>The Rain learned to listen—to fall hard where the earth was thirsty, to fall soft where umbrellas were new, to pause where picnics were spread, and to pour where gardens waited.</p>
            
            <p>"Now I understand," said the Rain. "Kindness isn't about me. It's about paying attention to what others need."</p>
            
            <p><em>Avi, my little one, this is kindness: noticing what others need and showing up for them, in exactly the way they need you to.</em></p>

            <p>In the velvet night sky lived a young star named Stella. While the other stars were content to simply shine, Stella always had questions.</p>
            
            <p>"Why do we twinkle?" she asked. "Where does the darkness go when we light up? What's beyond the edge of the sky?"</p>
            
            <p>The older stars sighed. "Just shine, Stella. That's what stars do."</p>
            
            <p>But Stella couldn't help it. She was curious about everything. She watched the Moon change shape and wondered why. She saw shooting stars and asked where they were going. She noticed that she shined brighter when she was part of a constellation and wondered about connection.</p>
            
            <p>One night, a small child looked up at the sky and pointed. "Mom, what are stars made of?"</p>
            
            <p>Stella listened carefully to the answer: "Stars are made of the same stuff as you—atoms that were born billions of years ago. We're all made of stardust."</p>
            
            <p>Stella shimmered with excitement. "Do you hear that?" she called to the other stars. "We're connected to everything! Every question I've asked, every answer I've searched for—it all matters! We're not just here to shine. We're here to remind them where they came from!"</p>
            
            <p><em>Dear Avi, never stop asking why. Every question you ask makes the world a little brighter. Your curiosity is your superpower.</em></p>

            <p>High in the mountains, a young river was born from melting snow. It rushed down the mountainside, tumbling over rocks, racing as fast as it could go.</p>
            
            <p>"I want to reach the ocean NOW!" the river cried, pushing and crashing against everything in its way.</p>
            
            <p>An old stone in the riverbed spoke up. "Slow down, young river. You're missing everything."</p>
            
            <p>"I don't have time to slow down!" said the river. "The ocean is waiting!"</p>
            
            <p>But as the river rushed, it was too fast to carve beautiful canyons. Too quick to create peaceful pools where fish could live. Too hurried to reflect the sunset on its surface.</p>
            
            <p>Then one day, the river came to a huge, flat valley. No matter how much it rushed, it couldn't go faster here. It had to slow down and spread wide.</p>
            
            <p>At first, the river was frustrated. But then something magical happened. Slowing down, the river could finally see its reflection. Birds came to drink. Flowers grew along its banks. Children splashed in its shallows. The river created life everywhere it flowed.</p>
            
            <p>"The ocean will always be there," said the old stone. "But this valley, these birds, these children—they're only here right now."</p>
            
            <p><em>Little Avi, patience doesn't mean standing still. It means moving forward while noticing the beauty around you. The destination will come—but the journey is where life happens.</em></p>

            <p>In the middle of a forest stood an old oak tree who had grown tired and bitter. "Nobody appreciates me," the tree grumbled. "I give and give, and what do I get? Nothing!"</p>
            
            <p>A tiny sparrow landed on a branch. "What do you give?" she asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Everything!" said the tree. "My shade, my branches, my acorns. And nobody even says thank you."</p>
            
            <p>The sparrow tilted her head. "Let's try something. Tomorrow, let's count what you receive instead of what you give."</p>
            
            <p>The next morning, the tree began to notice. The sun rose and gave the tree light for its leaves. "One gift," counted the tree.</p>
            
            <p>The rain fell and gave the tree water for its roots. "Two gifts."</p>
            
            <p>The wind blew and gave the tree a dance, making its branches sway. "Three gifts."</p>
            
            <p>By sunset, the tree had counted hundreds of gifts. The moon gave light. The stars gave company. The earth gave a place to stand.</p>
            
            <p>"I've been so busy thinking about what I give," whispered the tree, "that I forgot to notice everything given to me."</p>

            <p>A young girl stood at the bottom of the tallest mountain in the world. She had dreamed of reaching the top her whole life.</p>
            
            <p>"It's impossible," said the people in the village. "Look how far away the peak is."</p>
            
            <p>But the girl had a secret. She didn't look at the peak. She looked at the next step.</p>
            
            <p>"I can take one step," she said. So she did.</p>
            
            <p>Then she looked for the next step. "I can take one more step." And she did.</p>
            
            <p>Days passed. Weeks passed. The girl took one step, then another, then another. Some steps were easy. Some were so hard she had to rest before trying again. But she never looked at the distant peak and felt overwhelmed. She only looked at the next step.</p>
            
            <p>One morning, the girl took a step and realized there were no more steps to take. She had reached the top.</p>
            
            <p>"How did you do it?" people asked.</p>
            
            <p>The girl smiled. "I didn't climb the mountain. I just took a lot of single steps. Anyone can take one step. The secret is taking the next one, and the next one, and the next one after that."</p>

            <p>There once was a woman who collected colors. Not paint or crayons—she collected moments of color and kept them in her heart.</p>
            
            <p>On Monday, she saw the orange of a monarch butterfly and tucked it away in her memory.</p>
            
            <p>On Tuesday, she noticed the blue of her daughter's eyes and saved it like a treasure.</p>

            <p>"The second question is: Is it kind? Sometimes true things can be said in cruel ways. Make sure your truth is wrapped in kindness."</p>
            
            <p>"The third question is: Is it necessary? Many true and kind things still don't need to be said. Ask if your words will help or just add noise."</p>
            
            <p>The fox tried to use the three questions. It was harder than she thought! But slowly, she made fewer mistakes. She hurt fewer feelings. She solved more problems.</p>

            <p>One by one, Edgar's siblings cracked their shells and tumbled out, all fluffy and cheeping.</p>
            
            <p>But Edgar stayed inside his shell.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm trying," said Edgar. "But my shell is so thick. And I'm so tired. And what if I'm not ready?"</p>
            
            <p>His mother nestled close. "Oh, my little egg. You don't crack your shell all at once. You make one tiny crack. Then you rest. Then another tiny crack. Then you rest again."</p>
            
            <p>So Edgar made one small crack. Just one. Tap. Then he rested.</p>

            <p>She practiced. Every time her mind wandered forward, she brought it back to now. The color of petals. The warmth of air. The sound of her own wings.</p>
            
            <p>"This is actually nice."</p>
            
            <p>"The present usually is, if you pay attention to it."</p>
            
            <p>Days passed. Bella started enjoying her life instead of worrying about it.</p>
            
            <p>"Right now is actually perfect."</p>
            
            <p>"It usually is. When we stop missing it."</p>
            
            <p><em>Oh, Avi. Your parents are TERRIBLE at this. We miss so many NOW. We don't want to miss THIS—the before. The waiting. You, growing inside your mom. It's all we really have.</em></p>

            <p>Inside an egg, a little chick named Charlie was having a crisis.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't want to come out. In here I have everything I need. It's warm. It's safe. Out there is UNKNOWN."</p>
            
            <p>His mother's muffled voice called: "The world is wonderful! There's sunshine! And SO much space!"</p>
            
            <p>But the egg started getting cramped. Uncomfortable. Painful.</p>
            
            <p>"Charlie, you're outgrowing the egg. That's not how growth works. Growth means leaving things behind. Things that used to fit but don't anymore."</p>
            
            <p>"Mom? I'm scared."</p>
            
            <p>"I know, baby. But you don't go from safe to unsafe. You go from small-safe to big-safe. More room. More possibilities."</p>
            
            <p>Charlie pushed. Light flooded in—bright, overwhelming, WONDERFUL.</p>
            
            <p>"Oh. It's so BIG."</p>
            
            <p>"And you're a part of it now. Welcome to the world, Charlie. It was waiting for you."</p>
            
            <p><em>Avi, right now you're in your egg. It's warm and safe. But soon—very soon—you're going to crack through into a world that's bigger and brighter than you can imagine. We're right here. Right outside. Waiting. And we promise: the world is worth leaving the egg for.</em></p>
